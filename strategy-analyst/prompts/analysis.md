## Instructions

Analyze the backtest results and market conditions above. Based on your analysis:

1. Identify which symbols/strategies are underperforming and why
2. Consider how current market conditions (from news) should influence strategy parameters
3. Propose specific, targeted changes to improve performance
4. Ensure all changes respect the hard limits
5. If performance is already good and market conditions haven't changed significantly, recommend NO changes

Remember: Small, evidence-based adjustments are better than large speculative changes. Every change must have clear reasoning tied to the data provided.
